# Erasmus Genetic Programming - Physics Package

The physics package is responsible for defining the rules of operation for the primitives in the Erasmus "Universe".
For example, the physics model defines how pGC's are selected to operate on GC's.

**This is not a standalone package**

For more information on this package see the [Documentation Index](docs/index.md)
